= Manage group memberships

This page covers a guide on how to add or remove RBAC users to/from groups.

== Add user

Add a user to a group as an empty object.

TIP: The name of the user is a name of the RBAC user resource, which might not be the one the user is using to log in.

IMPORTANT: The name of the group is subject to some naming rules, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names[DNS Label Names].

The `state` property can be specified explicitly, but is `present` already by default.

== Remove user

If you have common groups "up" in the hierarchy, but want to remove a specific user from such a group, set the `state` property to `absent`.

== Remove group

If you have common groups "up" in the hierarchy, but want to avoid such a group being applied to the cluster, set the `state` property to `absent`.
