= Deprecated features

== v2.3.0

Directly providing a Vault secret reference as a string in `openshift4_authentication.identityProviders.*.ldap.bindPassword` is **deprecated**.
Users should switch to the secret references mechanism, as documented in xref:how-tos/configure-secrets.adoc[configuring secrets for identity providers] how-to, as the legacy syntax will be removed in a future release.

See below for an example diff showing how to restructure an LDAP identity provider configuration from the legacy syntax to secret references.

<1> Name of the secret containing the LDAP bind password.
The name needs to be identical in both locations.
<2> The bind password **must** be stored in key `bindPassword` in the secret.
