= OpenShift 4 OAuth: A Commodore component to manage OAuth on OpenShift 4

{doctitle} is a Commodore component for Managing the OpenShift 4 OAuth config.
The component allows to configure identity providers, templates to customize the look and feel of the login and the validity of the issued tokens.

This reflects what is documented by `oc explain --api-version config.openshift.io/v1 OAuth` with some small tweaks to simplify the input.

The parameters `openshift4_oauth.templates.(err,login,providerSelection)` directly take the template string.
The values will be written to a secret which then gets referenced in the OAuth CRD.

As of know, the paramter `openshift4_oauth.identityProviders` can only handle provider configs of type LDAP.
The documentation requires to configure the LDAP bind password as a secret, and the CA certificate as a config map, the component accepts their literal value.
Secrets and config maps will be created and referenced as needed.
